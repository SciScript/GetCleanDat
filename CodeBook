The dataset NinaDataset.txt comprises 180 observations of 68 variables and had been created with the R script named
run_analysis.R. 

THE EXPERIMENT:
30 subjects (aged 19-48 years) performed different activities while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist, 
which was equipped with an embedded accelerometer and gyroscope. The triaxial linear acceleration and the triaxial angular 
velocity of the subjects were measured while performing the respective activities as raw signals in the time domain at a 
constant rate of 50Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner 
frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. The acceleration signal has a gravitational and body motion components and was separated 
using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. Various values were measured for each subject 
one activity and different variables were calculated based the raw data.  

THE DATASET:
The dataset NinaDataset.txt contains mean values for each subject and each activity. The subject numbers and activities present
the first two columns of the dataset. All following columns contain mean values of the mean and standard deviation, 
respectively, of different variables that were calculated from the initial raw data. The variable names are aggregated names 
derived from the following abbreviations:
   t          - time domain
   f          - frequency domain
   Acc        - accelerometer
   Gyro       - gyroscope
   Body       - body motion (component)
   Gravity    - gravitational motion component
   Mean       - mean value
   Std        - standard deviation
   X, Y, Z    - denote triaxial signals in the X, Y and Z directions of the triaxial acceleration or triaxial velocity
   jerk       - jerk of the body
   mag        - magnitude of the three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm
